MeshphoneGen is a utlitiy program for reading the area code XML file maintained by Mark N2MH and converting it to meshphone routing tables.
It runs in two modes: either reading a local file, or downloading from a URL. It is recommended to set up a CRON process to run it
once a week to keep up with current changes.

Have fun.
